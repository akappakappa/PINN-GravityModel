# Gravity Model using PINNs
This Master's Thesis project is about the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the gravity model problem for celestial bodies.  
MATLAB R2024b is used for the implementation of the project.

### TODO
- Fill in the README.md file with additional information, and update TODO section as the project progresses.
- [ ] Produce a basis model based on current literature.
    - [ ] Replicate in MATLAB the work done for the paper ["Physics-informed neural networks for gravity field modeling of the Earth and Moon"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10569-022-10069-5).
    - [ ] Apply further modifications proposed in ["Physics-Informed Neural Network Gravity Model Generation III"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10257).
- [ ] Ask professor for further guidance...
